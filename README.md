## Project Overview

### Welcome to the **Overlook Hotel**!
Overlook is an application that allows the user login as a customer of the Hotel Hotel. Each customer has previous bookings that can be viewed from the customer dashboard. The user can click the Book Room button to create a new booking. From that page, the user can select a check-in date. Any available rooms will display and the user can make their selection then, or they can choose to filter their search by room type. Once the user clicks the Book Now button on their desired room, they will see a message informing them if their booking was successful or not. From there, they can go back to their dashboard or make another booking request.

### Learning Goals and Outcomes
My main goals for this project were to successfully implement fetch API, and Webpack, and develop practices for making an app accessible.
I decided to keep the design as simple as possible to focus on the functionality and ensure the app was easy to navigate. I would like to make the design a bit more complex in future iterations.


### Future Features
- Refactor styling to utilize SCSS/SASS.
- Add functionality to create a manager profile that can amend and delete reservations.
